# doc-sharing

Setup -> 
1. run `npm install` in the doc_sharing folder
2. run `npm install` in the server folder
3. run `npm run devstart` in the server folder
4. run `npm start` in the doc_sharing folder


Note: ports 3000 and 3003 have to be used for doc_sharing and server respectively. use `npx kill-port 3000` if react shows "port 3000 already in use"
